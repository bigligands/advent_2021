### Advent of Code: 2021

I'm posting the solutions I come up with to the puzzles available in the `Advent of Code 2021` challenge. I'm doing these puzzles as a means to help me familiarize myself with the Rust programming language and to strengthen my problem solving skills.
I am attempting to solve them without any help, but I will seek some hints if I spend too much time stuck on a single question.
I am also doing this challenge as practice for the 2022 Advent of Code puzzles being released in December.
